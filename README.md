# DataEngineerCars
This repo contains the raw uncleaned data files for a data engineering challenge.

The challenge, create a presentation (powerpoint or similar) to show how you have approached each of the steps below. 
Load the files into Snowflake
Work out how to join them together in a SQL View
Use that view in Python script to:
Profile the data i.e.
  Number of values for each column
  Number of distinct values for each column
  data type, highest, lowest, average values, 
  number of missing values
  Any outliers 
Then work out an approach to deal with missing data.
  Justify the approach
Work out an approach to deal with the outliers
  Justify the approach
Work out an approach to cleanse the data while preserving the original data. 
Implement your approach.
